Class 2 - Manual Testing

Recap --
	
Why do we need to test?
To assure the quality of the software, we need to test it.


STLC - 

requirement analysis - We analyse the requirements based on the smart criteria

test planning - test plan - Test/QA Lead/ manager


test case development -

Testing heirarchy -

Dev - where developers develop the application
Test/qa - where QA engineers perform testing
Staging/cert/qual/MR3 - where client testers perform testing/uat testing
production - it is live environment

What we should do when we found a bug?

Verify if it is reproducible or not
Read the req to make sure that the bug you found is actually a bug


intermittent bugs (sometimes they appear sometimes they don't)


BUG LIFE CYCLE

How to report it?

COLLECT AS MUCH AS INFORMATION POSSIBLE:
- exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
-Browser, time, the environment, test data, logs, screenshots or screen recording

Severity - the seriousness of the defect
Priority - it defines the order in which our bug should be fixed


Cucumber / BDD / Gherkin


It allows you to write test cases/scenarios in simple plain english sentences

Every scenario in BDD represents a Test case

Given - it represents pre condition
When - to perform actions
Then - expected result
And - supporting tag

Scenario - Verify the login functionality for amazon

Given user is able to access amazon application in browser
When user enters username in username textfield
And user enters password in password textfield
And user clicks on login button
Then user should be able to see home page



it is recommended and best practice to write cucumber scenarios in third person point of view
it is used to describe business rules



HOMEWORK -

Write 5 cucumber test cases due by saturday 3 pm for amazon


Types of testing -

2 types -
	Functional - to check the functionality of the application
	non-functional - backend testing behind the scenes

	Regression testing - testing the complete functionality/ all the test cases called regression testing
	

unit testing 
integration testing
system testing
Smoke testing
UAT

Class 4 - Manual testing

Recap - regression testing

integration testing
Performance testing
508 Compliance testing
Ad hoc testing - exploratory testing, informal testing



Project/Test management tool


HP ALM - application lifecycle management
HP QC
Devops Azure
Rally
Trello
JIRA - most popular
Test rail
etc

why project management tool?

to see the project status
reporting purpose
user stories, sprint backlog, test cases, burn down charts tasks, product backlog etc



Class 5 - 


Cucumber -

Acceptance criteria: 



Given - pre condition
When - to perform actions
Then - Expected results
And - supporting tag


Acceptance criteria - 


DOR - Definition of ready - When scrum team gets the complete details about the user story and estimated it properly for taking up for
the development

DOD - Definition of done - When development is done, testing is done, status of all test cases for this user story is green and code is 
committed, then DOD is completed.




Agile ceremonies

Product backlog - it has all the product user story items
Sprint backlog - we take only those items we will work on during sprint


You cannot delete any item from jira - bcz sometimes you need long history to track the project


Sprint planning - 
Sprint daily scrum standup
Sprint grooming
Sprint demo
Sprint retrospective
