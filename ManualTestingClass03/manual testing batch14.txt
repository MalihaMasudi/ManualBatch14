Testing heirarchy -

Dev - where developers develop the application

What we should do when we found a bug?

Verify if it is reproducible or not
Read the req to make sure that the bug you found is actually a bug


intermittent bugs (sometimes they appear sometimes they don't)


BUG LIFE CYCLE

How to report it?

COLLECT AS MUCH AS INFORMATION POSSIBLE:
- exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
-Browser, time, the environment, test data, logs, screenshots or screen recording

Severity - the seriousness of the defect
Priority - it defines the order in which our bug should be fixed


Cucumber / BDD / Gherkin


It allows you to write test cases/scenarios in simple plain english sentences

Every scenario in BDD represents a Test case

Given - it represents pre condition
When - to perform actions
Then - expected result
And - supporting tag

Scenario - Verify the login functionality for amazon

Given user is able to access amazon application in browser
When user enters username in username textfield
And user enters password in password textfield
And user clicks on login button
Then user should be able to see home page



it is recommended and best practice to write cucumber scenarios in third person point of view
it is used to describe business rules



HOMEWORK -
